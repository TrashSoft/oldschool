Old school Java Swing - Clojure gaming engine

### Old School Game Engine

Started developing of a small gaming framework with detecting a few keys and drawing sprites.
It is designed so that would be easy to use with Clojure as well.
A small example can be found in `res/test.clj`, which may be started `ClojureRunnerTest.java`.

### Mole In the Hole

Using the mentioned engine I started developing a clone of an old C64 / C16 game
as an example to show how the engine works (and to play with it, of course).

### Other Instructions

The projects are made quick and dirty, using Eclipse IDE (and Maven 3).
The resource files are in the right path for Eclipse, but I don't know if they will be found
when running a different way.
